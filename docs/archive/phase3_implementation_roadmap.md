## Critical Success Factors

### Code Quality Standards
```python
# Every file must have:
"""
Module docstring explaining purpose and usage.

This module implements [specific functionality] for [specific purpose].
It follows [specific patterns] and integrates with [specific systems].

Example:
    >>> from module import Class
    >>> instance = Class()
    >>> result = instance.method()

Note:
    Production considerations and performance characteristics.
"""

# Every class must have:
class ExampleClass:
    """
    Brief description of class purpose.
    
    Longer description explaining when and how to use this class,
    its responsibilities, and its relationships with other classes.
    
    Attributes:
        attr1 (type): Description of attribute
        attr2 (type): Description of attribute
    
    Example:
        >>> instance = ExampleClass()
        >>> instance.process(data)
    """

# Every method must have:
def method_name(self, param1: Type1, param2: Type2) -> ReturnType:
    """
    Brief description of what method does.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of parameter
        param2: Description of parameter
    
    Returns:
        Description of return value
    
    Raises:
        ExceptionType: When this exception occurs
    
    Note:
        Any performance or security considerations
    """
```

### Testing Standards
```python
# Minimum 90% coverage
# Performance benchmarks for every component
# Security tests for privacy components
# Integration tests for all workflows
# Load tests for scalability validation
```

### Performance Standards
```python
# Every operation must have benchmarks
@benchmark
def operation():
    # Target: < 100ms for standard operations
    # Target: < 1s for complex operations
    pass

# Every API endpoint must have SLOs
# p50 < 200ms
# p95 < 1s
# p99 < 2s
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **ML Model Accuracy**: Have fallback rules-based system
2. **Performance Issues**: Start with conservative limits
3. **Integration Complexity**: Incremental integration
4. **Third-party Dependencies**: Abstract behind interfaces

### Schedule Risks
1. **Falling Behind**: Focus on core features first
2. **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined specifications
3. **Quality Issues**: Never compromise on tests
4. **Integration Delays**: Start integration early
