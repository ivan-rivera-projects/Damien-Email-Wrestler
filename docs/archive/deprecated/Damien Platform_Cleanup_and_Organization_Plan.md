🗂️ DOCUMENTATION CLEANUP STRATEGY
PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE CLEANUP (Week 1)
Remove System Files
bash# Safe to remove immediately
find . -name ".DS_Store" -delete
find . -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
find . -name ".pytest_cache" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
rm -f */server.log
rm -f testing_results.txt
Archive Obsolete Planning Documents
Create Archive Structure:
bashmkdir -p archive/{planning-docs,status-tracking,implementation-logs}
Files to Archive:

DAMIEN_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md ➔ archive/planning-docs/
DAMIEN_ENHANCEMENT_STATUS_UPDATE.md ➔ archive/status-tracking/
DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_PLAN.md ➔ archive/planning-docs/
DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md ➔ archive/status-tracking/
Damien_Enhancement_Checklist.md ➔ archive/planning-docs/
Damien_Optimization_and_Enhancement_Plan.md ➔ archive/planning-docs/
NEXT_STEPS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md ➔ archive/planning-docs/

MCP Server Status Files:

damien-mcp-server/ALL_TOOLS_FIXED_STATUS.md ➔ archive/status-tracking/
damien-mcp-server/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md ➔ archive/status-tracking/
damien-mcp-server/FIXES_SUMMARY.md ➔ archive/implementation-logs/

PHASE 2: CONSOLIDATE DOCUMENTATION (Week 1-2)
Create New Documentation Structure
