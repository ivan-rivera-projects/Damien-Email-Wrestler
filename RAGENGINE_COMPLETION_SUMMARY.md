### 🏗️ **Technical Implementation Completed**

#### **Vector Database Operations**
```python
# Real indexing implementation working
chunk_embeddings = self.embedding_model.encode(chunk_texts)
self.vector_db.collection.add(
    embeddings=all_embeddings,
    documents=all_chunks,
    metadatas=all_metadatas,
    ids=all_ids
)

# Real search implementation working
query_embedding = self.embedding_model.encode([query])
search_results = self.vector_db.collection.query(
    query_embeddings=query_embedding.tolist(),
    n_results=limit,
    include=['documents', 'metadatas', 'distances']
)
```

#### **Enterprise Integration Points**
- **PrivacyGuardian**: `protect_email_content()` with ProtectionLevel.STANDARD ✅
- **IntelligentChunker**: `chunk_document()` with metadata enrichment ✅
- **ChromaDB**: Persistent vector storage with cosine similarity ✅
- **Sentence-Transformers**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model operational ✅
