## 📖 Usage Examples

### Basic Routing
```python
from damien_cli.features.ai_intelligence.llm_integration.routing import IntelligenceRouter
from damien_cli.features.ai_intelligence.llm_integration.routing.router import ProcessingTask, Constraints

router = IntelligenceRouter()
task = ProcessingTask(
    email_data={"subject": "Meeting", "body": "Let's meet tomorrow"},
    task_type="categorization"
)
constraints = Constraints(max_cost=0.01)
decision = await router.route(task, constraints)
```

### Cost-Optimized Routing
```python
constraints = Constraints(
    max_cost=0.005,
    strategy=RoutingStrategy.COST_OPTIMIZED
)
decision = await router.route(task, constraints)
```

### Quality-Optimized Routing  
```python
constraints = Constraints(
    min_quality=0.9,
    strategy=RoutingStrategy.QUALITY_OPTIMIZED
)
decision = await router.route(task, constraints)
```

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Email Pipeline Integration
The router integrates seamlessly with existing email management:
```python
# In gmail_analyzer.py (future enhancement)
async def analyze_with_llm(self, emails, enhancement_level="auto"):
    for email in emails:
        task = ProcessingTask(email_data=email)
        decision = await self.router.route(task, constraints)
        # Process using selected pipeline
```

### CLI Command Enhancement
```bash
# Future CLI commands will support:
poetry run damien analyze --use-llm --enhancement-level=auto --max-cost=0.01
```
