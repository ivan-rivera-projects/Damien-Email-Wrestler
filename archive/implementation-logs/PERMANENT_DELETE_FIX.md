# Additional Fix Needed - Permanent Delete Function

## Issue Found
When trying to permanently delete emails, the system is calling the wrong module for `batch_delete_permanently`.

## Fix Applied âœ…
**File**: `/app/services/damien_adapter.py`
**Change**: Updated permanent delete function to call integration layer instead of service layer:

```python
# OLD (incorrect):
success = self.damien_gmail_module.batch_delete_permanently(...)

# NEW (correct):
success = damien_gmail_integration_module.batch_delete_permanently(...)
```

## Alternative Approach for Now

Since this requires another server restart, I can:

1. **Move emails to trash first** (works immediately)
2. **You can manually permanently delete from trash later**
3. **Or restart server and then permanently delete**

## Emails to Delete
Found 14 emails from sales@notice.alibaba.com since March 2025:
- From March 10 to May 25, 2025
- All promotional/spam emails
- IDs ready for deletion

## Status
- âœ… Fix applied to adapter
- ðŸ”„ Requires server restart to take effect
- ðŸ”„ Alternative: Trash now, permanently delete after restart

This is the same pattern we've seen - adapter calling service layer instead of integration layer for Gmail operations.
