# Critical Fix Applied - Context Variable Issue ✅

## Issue Found After Server Restart

**Error**: `cannot access local variable 'mcp_response' where it is not associated with a value`

**Root Cause**: In the router context preparation, I was trying to use `mcp_response.tool_result_id` before the `mcp_response` object was created.

## Fix Applied ✅

**File**: `/app/routers/tools.py`

**Problem Code**:
```python
context = {
    "session_id": session_id,
    "user_id": user_id,
    "tool_name": tool_name,
    "timestamp": mcp_response.tool_result_id  # ERROR: mcp_response not yet created
}
```

**Fixed Code**:
```python
context = {
    "session_id": session_id,
    "user_id": user_id,
    "tool_name": tool_name,
    "timestamp": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()  # Use current timestamp instead
}
```

**Additional Fix**: Added required import:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone
```

## Status ✅

- **Issue**: Fixed the variable scope problem
- **Import**: Added datetime imports  
- **Testing**: Ready for server restart and testing

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Server**: Apply this final fix
2. **Test Draft Creation**: Should now work without errors
3. **Verify All Tools**: All registry-based tools should function correctly

This was the final piece needed to complete the comprehensive tool fix system.
