### **Monitoring Points**
```python
# Log patterns to monitor:
"Converted RuleDefinitionModel to dict"  # Model conversion success
"Using provided dictionary"              # Direct dictionary usage
"rule_definition must be a RuleDefinitionModel or dictionary" # Type errors
```

### **Alert Conditions**
- Rule creation failure rate >5%
- Type conversion errors >10 per hour
- Unexpected input types detected
- Memory usage spikes during rule processing
