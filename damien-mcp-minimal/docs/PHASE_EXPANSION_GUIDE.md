# Phase Expansion Guide for Damien MCP Minimal Server

This guide provides detailed instructions for safely expanding the Damien MCP Minimal Server through all six phases, gradually introducing the full set of 40 tools while maintaining stability and compatibility with Claude Desktop.

## Overview

The Damien MCP Minimal Server uses a phased approach to tool deployment, starting with just 5 essential tools in Phase 1 and gradually expanding to all 40 tools across 6 phases. This approach ensures:

1. **Stability**: Each phase is thoroughly tested before proceeding
2. **Gradual Integration**: Tools are added in logical functional groups
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Each phase has specific performance criteria
4. **Safe Rollback**: Problems can be isolated to specific phases
5. **Systematic Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for each phase

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Focus Area                 | Tool Count | Cumulative Total |
|-------|----------------------------|------------|------------------|
| 1     | Essential Core             | 5          | 5                |
| 2     | Basic Actions              | 7          | 12               |
| 3     | Thread Management          | 5          | 17               |
| 4     | Rule Management            | 5          | 22               |
| 5     | AI Intelligence            | 9          | 31               |
| 6     | Account Settings           | 6          | 37               |

## Prerequisites

Before beginning phase expansion, ensure:

1. **Successful Migration**: Phase 1 is working correctly with Claude Desktop
2. **Testing Environment**: All tests pass on Phase 1
3. **Backend Availability**: Backend server supports all required tools
4. **Performance Baseline**: Established baseline performance metrics for Phase 1

## Expansion Procedure

### Automated Expansion

The easiest way to expand to the next phase is using the provided script:

```bash
cd damien-mcp-minimal
./scripts/expand-to-phase.sh --phase 2
```

This script will:
1. Back up current configuration
2. Update environment to specify the new phase
3. Restart the minimal MCP server
4. Run validation tests for the new phase
5. Automatically rollback if validation fails

### Manual Expansion

If you prefer to expand manually, follow these steps:

1. **Update Environment Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # In .env file
   DAMIEN_INITIAL_PHASE=2  # Replace with target phase number
   ```

2. **Restart the Server**:
   ```bash
   npm restart
   ```

3. **Validate the Expansion**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:phase
   ```

4. **Test with Claude Desktop**:
   Verify that Claude Desktop can access and use the new tools

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback

If the expansion script detects validation failures, it will automatically roll back to the previous phase. You can also manually trigger a rollback:

```bash
./scripts/expand-to-phase.sh --rollback
```

### Manual Rollback

To manually roll back to a previous phase:

1. **Update Environment Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # In .env file
   DAMIEN_INITIAL_PHASE=1  # Replace with target phase number
   ```

2. **Restart the Server**:
   ```bash
   npm restart
   ```

3. **Validate the Rollback**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:phase
   ```

## Performance Monitoring

Each phase has specific performance criteria that must be met before proceeding to the next phase. You can monitor performance using the built-in tools:

```bash
npm run benchmark
```

This will generate a report with key metrics:
- Response times for each tool
- Error rates
- Cache hit rates
- Memory usage patterns

## Troubleshooting

For detailed troubleshooting guidance specific to each phase, refer to the [Phase Troubleshooting Guide](./PHASE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

Common issues to watch for during expansion:

1. **Tool Availability**: Ensure backend supports all tools in the phase
2. **Performance Degradation**: Watch for increased response times or error rates
3. **Memory Leaks**: Monitor memory usage during extended operation
4. **Tool Interactions**: Some tools may have unexpected interactions
5. **Claude Desktop Compatibility**: Verify Claude Desktop works with each phase

## Success Criteria Checklists

Before considering a phase expansion successful, verify:

- [ ] All tests pass for the new phase
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds the criteria for the phase
- [ ] Claude Desktop can use all tools in the phase
- [ ] No unexpected errors occur during normal operation
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect any phase-specific behaviors
- [ ] Rollback procedure has been tested and works correctly

## Best Practices

1. **Incremental Testing**: Test each new tool individually before testing combinations
2. **Monitoring**: Keep performance monitoring active during expansion
3. **Backup**: Always back up configuration before expanding
4. **User Impact**: Consider the impact on active users during expansion
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation with any phase-specific information

By following this guide, you can safely expand the Damien MCP Minimal Server through all phases while maintaining stability and performance.
