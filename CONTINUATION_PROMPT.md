# Damien Email Wrestler - Dynamic Mode Detection Implementation Prompt

## üéØ **Context & Objective**

You are working on the Damien Email Wrestler v4.0 - an AI-powered email management system with 34 MCP tools. The user has a 100k+ email inbox and needs a dynamic mode detection system to handle both normal email operations and bulk/cleanup operations seamlessly.

## üìã **Current Status**

We have completed the architecture documentation and identified the need for a **Dynamic Per-Operation Mode Detection System** that automatically switches between operation modes based on the scale and context of each email operation.

## üîß **What Needs to be Implemented**

Design and implement a **Dynamic Mode Detection System** with the following requirements:

### **Core Requirements:**
1. **No Global Mode State** - Each operation determines its own optimal mode
2. **Smart Auto-Detection** - Based on parameters, query patterns, and scale  
3. **Easy Override** - Users can force specific modes when needed
4. **Seamless Switching** - No explicit mode changes required
5. **Safety Escalation** - Larger operations automatically get more safety checks

### **Operation Modes to Support:**
```python
class OperationMode(Enum):
    NORMAL = "normal"           # 1-1000 emails (interactive operations)
    BULK = "bulk"              # 1k-50k emails (background processing)
    ARCHIVE_CLEANUP = "cleanup" # 50k+ emails (massive cleanup operations)
    MAINTENANCE = "maintenance" # System-wide operations
```

### **Mode Detection Triggers:**
- **Email Volume**: max_emails, max_results parameters
- **Query Patterns**: "older_than:2y", "category:promotions", etc.
- **Operation Type**: archive, delete, bulk_label operations
- **Time Scope**: Large date ranges indicating cleanup intent
- **User Intent**: Natural language indicators of bulk operations

### **Mode-Specific Configurations:**
Each mode should have different:
- Chunk sizes (100 ‚Üí 5000)
- Concurrent requests (5 ‚Üí 15)
- AI model selection (GPT-4 ‚Üí cheaper models for bulk)
- Safety checks (standard ‚Üí maximum)
- Progress tracking (off ‚Üí detailed)
- Confirmation requirements
- Rollback capabilities

## üõ†Ô∏è **Specific Implementation Tasks**

1. **Design the Mode Detection Engine**
   - Auto-detection logic based on operation parameters
   - Pattern matching for bulk operation indicators
   - Fallback and override mechanisms

2. **Implement Mode Configuration Profiles**
   - Configuration objects for each mode
   - Resource allocation strategies
   - Safety mechanism escalation

3. **Modify Existing MCP Tools**
   - Add mode detection to all 34 tools
   - Implement adaptive parameter handling
   - Add mode-specific error handling

4. **Create New Bulk-Specific Tools**
   - Tools optimized for 100k+ email scenarios
   - Specialized cleanup and analysis tools
   - Progress tracking and safety mechanisms

5. **Safety & Rollback System**
   - Mandatory dry-run for large operations
   - Rollback capabilities for bulk changes
   - Progress snapshots and recovery

## üìÅ **Required Context Documents**

To provide full context, attach these documents to your chat:

### **Essential Files:**
1. **`/tmp/damien_architecture_v4.md`** - Complete architecture documentation
2. **`paste.txt`** - Original architecture overview (if available)
3. **Any existing MCP tool definitions** - Current tool implementations
4. **Configuration files** - Current system configuration

### **Key Context Points:**
- System uses FastAPI with MCP protocol integration
- 34 MCP tools across 6 categories (Email, Thread, Draft, Rules, Settings, AI Intelligence)
- AI Intelligence layer with privacy-first architecture
- Current max_results limits are 100-500 across tools
- User has 100k+ emails needing cleanup
- Production-ready system with enterprise requirements

## üéØ **User's Specific Use Case**

**Scenario**: User has 100k+ emails in inbox and wants to use Damien to get it under control.

**Current Limitations Identified:**
- Max results capped at 100-500 emails
- No bulk operation modes
- No specialized cleanup tools
- Limited progress tracking for large operations

**Desired Outcome**: 
- Seamless handling of both 10-email and 10,000-email operations
- Automatic mode detection without user intervention
- Optimized processing strategies for different scales
- Enhanced safety for bulk operations

## üöÄ **Implementation Priority**

1. **Phase 1**: Core mode detection engine and configuration profiles
2. **Phase 2**: Modify existing tools to support dynamic modes
3. **Phase 3**: Create specialized bulk operation tools
4. **Phase 4**: Implement safety and rollback mechanisms
5. **Phase 5**: Testing and optimization for 100k+ email scenarios

## üí° **Key Design Principles**

- **User Transparency**: Users shouldn't need to think about modes
- **Safety First**: Larger operations get more safety checks automatically
- **Performance Optimization**: Different strategies for different scales
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing tool calls should continue working
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallbacks when auto-detection is uncertain

## üìù **Expected Deliverables**

1. **Mode Detection Engine** - Core logic for automatic mode selection
2. **Configuration Profiles** - Mode-specific settings and strategies
3. **Enhanced Tool Definitions** - Updated MCP tools with mode support
4. **New Bulk Tools** - Specialized tools for large-scale operations
5. **Safety Framework** - Rollback, dry-run, and confirmation systems
6. **Implementation Guide** - How to integrate with existing system
7. **Testing Strategy** - Validation approach for different scales

## üîÑ **Continue From This Point**

Please design and implement the **Dynamic Mode Detection System** starting with the core mode detection engine, then proceed through the implementation phases. Focus on the user's 100k+ email scenario while ensuring the system remains efficient for normal operations.
